### What is this website?

Sashay4Solar is a now defunct initiative started by my old team who organized [Sweat4Syria](https://kyrm.org/meet-the-volunteer-organizers-behind-sweat4syria/). We had the intention of creating a residential-area solar panel array to help power homes in the West End here in Louisville, KY. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, this initiative has not been executed at present. 

This website would have served as a landing page for the Sashay4Solar gala. I designed this within the first year of my learning HTML5, CSS3, & front-end JavaScript. I understood, after developing this website, the need to take into consideration rendering speed of resources such as images and how various technologies interacted with one another.
